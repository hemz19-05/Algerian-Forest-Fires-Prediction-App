### Algerian Forest Fire Prediction (ML + Flask + AWS Deployment)

This project predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) for Algerian forest fire regions using a Machine Learning model.
The primary objective of this project was to practice:

🌐 Building and deploying a full end-to-end ML application

⚙️ Developing REST APIs using Flask

☁️ Deploying production-ready apps on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

🧩 Understanding real-world MLOps deployment workflows

This project is based on the ML deployment course by Krish Naik, and I extended it with my own deployment + pipeline setup.

# 🚀 Demo

Live App on AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

👉 http://algerianforestfiresprediction-env.eba-wvnihueh.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/predictdata

# 🔍 Problem Overview

Forest fires are a major environmental and safety issue in Algeria.
This application predicts the FWI using several meteorological features:

1. Temperature
2. Relative Humidity
3. Wind Speed
4. Rain
5. FFMC
6. DMC
7. ISI
8. Region + Classes

# 🧠 Model Used

Ridge Regression (Scikit-Learn)

Features scaled using StandardScaler

Model artifacts saved as:

model/ridg.pkl  
model/scaler.pkl

# 🧰 Tech Stack
ML & Backend:

✔ Python
✔ Flask (REST APIs)
✔ Scikit-learn
✔ Pandas, NumPy

Deployment & DevOps:

✔ AWS Elastic Beanstalk
✔ EC2
✔ Gunicorn
✔ .ebextensions config
✔ Linux virtual server environment

# 🖥️ How It Works

You enter the inputs:

Temperature, Rain, RH, Wind, FFMC, DMC, ISI, etc.


The app:

✔ Validates form input
✔ Passes it into the model
✔ Predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI)
✔ Returns the result to the UI

# ☁️ Deployment Workflow

🔥 Full deployment done on AWS:

✔Packaged app into deployment zip
✔ Added Procfile + Gunicorn
✔ Created EB environment
✔ Configured WSGI using .ebextensions/python.config
✔ Deployed successfully on AWS

# Key AWS Concepts Covered

✔ Elastic Beanstalk deployment
✔ E2C running Python 3.14
✔ WSGI server + Gunicorn
✔ Directory and WSGI routing
✔ Environment updates & logs troubleshooting

# 📝 REST API Endpoint
POST /predictdata


Request type: form data
Response: predicted FWI

🧪 Local Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
python application.py

🛠 Future Improvements

✔ Add UI styling (Bootstrap)
✔ Add Docker + CI/CD
✔ Use AWS RDS for logging predictions
✔ Build API versioning + JWT auth

# 📌 Motivation

This wasn’t just about building an ML model, it was specifically to learn real-world deployment for ML apps.

This helped me practice:

✔ Full-stack ML pipeline
✔ Deployment on cloud infrastructure
✔ Working with production server configurations
